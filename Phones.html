        <p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 is a brilliant smartphone with a lot of top-end features. It could easily be the number one choice for people who are willing to spend as much as it takes to have the latest and greatest features. However, it isn't very significantly differentiated from the Galaxy S series anymore, and in fact due to the vagaries of online pricing in India, all variants of the Galaxy S9, Galaxy S9 Plus and Galaxy Note 9 (except the 512GB Galaxy Note 9) are priced within roughly Rs. 10,000 of each other right now. The 128GB version of the Galaxy Note 9 costs almost exactly as much as the 128GB Galaxy S9 Plus. The experiences you get will be nearly identical, so the choice really comes down to having the S Pen versus having a slightly more portable device, or saving a bit of money. If you already own a Galaxy S8 or Galaxy Note 8, there's practically no reason at all to upgrade.</p>
        <p>The phenomenal battery life you'd get is another huge point in favour of the Galaxy Note 9. On the other hand, the size and weight will be a bit too much for a lot of people too. We aren't really considering this a phone for productivity because even Samsung isn't differentiating it as such anymore, but it definitely will serve a power user who wants to get work done. In a world full of nearly identical smartphones, the Galaxy Note 9 does stand out, and while it is expensive, you get what you pay for.</p>

        <p>Looking at the OnePlus 7T Pro, we can't help but feel as though OnePlus was obligated to refresh the OnePlus 7 Pro, just so it wouldn't look old and irrelevant now that we have the OnePlus 7T. We would have liked to have seen more meaningful upgrades, like the OnePlus 7T received, but this isn't the case with the OnePlus 7T Pro. There isn't much differentiation between the two product tiers anymore, apart from the higher-resolution curved display and the pop-up camera on the more expensive model.</p>
        <p>The OnePlus 7T Pro looks and feels premium, and does a lot of things well. It features an excellent display, good stereo sound, very good software, and useful camera capabilities. It's still a bit on the heavier side though, and we're still waiting on wireless charging and IP-rated waterproofing. The new software has fixed some of the niggles that we previously encountered with the cameras, but this phone still struggles with capturing video, especially in low light.</p>
        <p>This is one of the best looking phones at Rs. 53,999, but this is also a pretty steep premium over the OnePlus 7T, which offers very similar features. Some might argue that the design and display alone are worth the premium over the OnePlus 7T, and if you fall in that camp, then you won't be disappointed. If you want to go even crazier, you could opt for the McLaren Edition of the OnePlus 7T Pro at Rs. 58,999, which gets you 12GB of RAM, a fancier case, and a unique colour scheme.</p>
        <p>The OnePlus 7T Pro is a good flagship, but keep in mind that the Google Pixel 4 is right around the corner, and going by recent rumours, it could be priced very competitively. It just makes good sense to wait a bit and see how things play out, before spending this kind of money.</p>

        <p>The Galaxy Note 10+ is currently the best smartphone to roll out of Samsung's stable in India, and it is the company's new flagship. While this smartphone's design might be a little boxy, it packs in a stunning display, versatile cameras, and lots of software enhancements. Yes, you will notice the hole at the top of the display, but you can get used to this</p>
        <p>Samsung has added new functionality to the S Pen in the form of Air Actions, which work in certain supported apps. While it is helpful to use the S Pen as a remote shutter button for the camera, the other gestures feel a little gimmicky. The Galaxy Note 10+ also manages to deliver good battery life, and the bundled fast charger is a boon.</p>
        <p>Priced at Rs. 79,999 for the 12GB RAM, 256GB storage version, and Rs. 89,999 for the 12GB RAM, 512GB storage variant, the Galaxy Note 10+ might seem too expensive. However, considering what it offers in terms of performance, Samsung's software and hardware package isn't exorbitantly overpriced. If you don't mind spending this much money, the Galaxy Note 10+ is one of the best devices that money can buy at the moment.</p>
        <p>However, if you don't really care about the S Pen and want something more manageable, the Galaxy S10+ (Review) and the Galaxy S10 (Review) offer roughly the same experience (sans S Pen) for Rs. 73,900 and Rs. 61,900 respectively, making them suitable alternatives.</p>

        <p>The Honor View 20, with its hole-punch display, does stand out compared to its notched competitors. While it still doesn't have an all-screen front, it is a step in the right direction. The flashy Sapphire Blue colour is good to grab attention but the slippery back is something we were constantly worried about while using this smartphone.</p>
        <p>The new Kirin 980 SoC can hold on its own against current flagship processors. The software still has a bit of bloat that it can lose, and face recognition could do with a few tweaks to work better in low light.</p>
        <p>Priced at Rs. 37,999, the Honor View 20 goes head on against the OnePlus 6T (Review), which is a tough competitor. If you prefer a clean near stock Android experience, the OnePlus 6T offers a clear advantage, but if you absolutely want to be the first to own a device with a hole-punch display, go ahead. The View 20 is a solid performer without a lot of compromises.</p>
