            <p>It retains everything we liked about the previous XPS 13, fixes most of the things we didn’t like and offers significantly improved performance and an optional 4K display.</p> </td>

            <p>You can get a better screen and better performance on the Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA (for about $450) or Samsung Chromebook Pro ($529), though those laptops have smaller screens and cost more. You'll also get the flexibility of a 2-in-1 with either of those notebooks.</p><br>
                    
            <p>Still, at $350, the Chromebook 15 provides an affordable entry into the world of Chromebooks and, for those who want it, a larger alternative to the sub-13-inch notebooks we're used to. If you want to go big, this is the way to go.</p></td>

            <p>If you have the €1,999 asked for and want an Apple MacBook-style portable computing experience but with a Windows 10 OS, then this system is easy to recommend as one to seriously consider. It truly is a lovely tool to look at, hold and to use.</p></td>

            <p>Yes, the screen is bigger which might appeal to some who are intrigued by the prospect of cloud-based computing and want something more multimedia-friendly, but the extra screen estate does not mask the poor battery life, the uninspiring design and the fact that it is less portable than other Chromebooks.</p><br>
